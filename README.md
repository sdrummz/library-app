# My Library App

A library app to keep track of books you've read, are currently reading, or books on your reading list. This project focuses on JS Objects/constructors, and uses localStorage for persistence.

I will make this much better eventually, adding Firebase backend, UI redesign, adding new pages/features to view friends reading lists, chat/post reviews about books, etc.
